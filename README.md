# NoteBook App

Do you have a hard time going out the house because you are scared of the current pandemic? Are you willing to risk your health just to buy school supplies? Do you have tons of gadgets and would like to put it into use during online classes? Well say no more!! We created an app called "E-Note" for your needs as a student during the new normal! 

Our application would help you with taking down notes in a specific subject/course that you are currently enrolled! You are also required to put the class schedule of the subect/course. You can also put in the basic details of the subject, and the professor of the specific subject.

The user will type the title/topic of the current lesson, then the user will be able to take down notes while having the lecture so that he/she will not miss a thing and would remember the lesson at that specific day! Then hit save!

We also included "edit" which has the ability to change a saved note. To do so, hold the saved note, then choose edit, then you will be able to edit the previous note and you are also allowed to change the subject, schedule, professor, topic, and the content of the notes. 

Lastly, we also added a "delete" option, which can be used when the user do not need/is already finished with the topic. To delete a note, hold a saved note. Then, a delete option will appear, which will erase the note you have chosen.
